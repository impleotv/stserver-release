# StServer

The **STANAG On Demand Server** is a platform that delivers on-demand and live Full Motion Video (FMV) as well as geospatial metadata to video analysts and field operators. 
This service helps them easily access, analyze, and present mission-critical information, enabling faster decision-making and improved situational awareness. 
The server is designed to support NATO's Standardization Agreement (STANAG) requirements, ensuring compatibility with a range of military systems and applications. 
The server enhances the ability of analysts and operators to effectively monitor and respond to dynamic situations. 
With the **STANAG On Demand Server**, organizations can benefit from a comprehensive, scalable, and reliable solution for managing video and geospatial data.

## System Requirements

OS: Linux x64.

## Installation (using Docker Compose)

The **STANAG On Demand Server** is installed as a set of [microservices](https://www.impleotv.com/content/stserver2/help/microservices/microservices_overview/),
with Linux being the preferred operating system. Although the solution can be deployed by directly installing the components, this manual describes a  
method that uses containerization (with Docker) and service orchestration tools. For local server deployment (single host), we will use docker-compose, 
while Kubernetes is more suitable for distributed deployment.

## Known issues

- In the version 2.7.1 mongodb was downgraded to version 4.4.18 to allow runnning in the VM. If you're not using VM and have a more recent mongodb version, you can change 

```
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:4.4.18
```   
to 
```
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
```    
You should also do this if you're upgrading the server version and have your DB created with a more recent mongodb version, otherwise it won't work.

- If not restarted after install, first mission upload may fail. Delete the mission and upload again.
